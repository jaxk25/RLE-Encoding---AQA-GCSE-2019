# RLE Encoding - AQA GCSE 2019
 AQA Computer Science NEA for the 2019-2020 GCSE. Coded in Python 2.7.  
 This is NOT being submitted to AQA as part of a GCSE.  
 **THIS IS CURRENTLY BEING UPDATED**   
# Original Instructions:  
 The original instructions from AQA are as follows:  
>  1. A menu is displayed allowing the user to select from the following options:
>     1. Enter RLE
>     1. Display ASCII art
>     1. Convert to ASCII art
>     1. Convert to RLE
>     1. Quit
> 1. If the user selects the 'Quit' option then a suitable message should be displayed and the program ends.
> 1. If the user lects the 'Enter RLE' option:
>     1. The user is asked how many lines of RLE compressed data they want to enter
>     1. The program should check that the number entered is greater than 2 and if it isn’t display a suitable error message and get the user to keep re-entering the number until it is valid
>     1. If the user entered a valid number,they then enter the compressed data one line at a time until they have entered the specified number of lines
>     1. Once all the compressed data has been entered, the program decompresses the data and displays the ASCII art image
>     1. The user is returned to the main menu.
> 1. If the user selects the 'Display ASCII art' option:
>     1. The user is asked to enter the name of the text file that contains the ASCII art
>     1. The program reads the contents of the text file and displays the ASCII art image
>     1. The user is returned to the main menu.
> 1. If the user selects the 'Convert to ASCII art' option:
>     1. The user is asked to enter the name of the text file that contains the RLE compressed data
>     1. The program reads the contents of the text file, decompresses the data and displays the ASCII art image
>     1. The user is returned to the main menu.
> 1. If the user selects the 'Convert to RLE' option:
>     1. The user is asked to enter the name of the text file that contains the ASCII art
>     1. The program reads the contents of the text file, compresses each line and stores the compressed data in a new text file
>     1. The program calculates the difference between the number of characters used in the compressed and uncompressed versions of the ASCII art and displays this value
>     1. The user is retured to the main menu.  
>
